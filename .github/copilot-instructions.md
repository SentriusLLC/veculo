# Apache Accumulo (Veculo Repository)
Apache Accumulo is a sorted, distributed key/value store based on Google's BigTable design. It is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift. This repository contains a multi-module Java Maven project requiring Java 17.

**ALWAYS reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

## Working Effectively

### Environment Requirements
- **Java Version**: Java 17 (OpenJDK 17.0.16+ required)
- **Build Tool**: Apache Maven 3.9.11+
- **Memory**: 3-4GB free memory recommended for integration tests
- **Disk Space**: 10GB free disk space recommended for integration tests
- **Network**: **CRITICAL LIMITATION** - Apache snapshots repository (`repository.apache.org`) is not accessible due to DNS restrictions

### Build Status: **DOES NOT BUILD** 
**DO NOT attempt to build this repository** - it will fail due to network restrictions preventing access to essential dependencies.

#### Critical Build Limitation
```bash
# This command WILL FAIL - do not attempt:
mvn clean package
# Error: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.accumulo:accumulo-access:pom:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
# from/to apache.snapshots (https://repository.apache.org/snapshots): repository.apache.org
```

**Root Cause**: The project depends on `org.apache.accumulo:accumulo-access:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` which is only available from Apache snapshots repository. This dependency is essential - it provides core classes like `AccessEvaluator`, `AccessExpression` used throughout the codebase and cannot be removed.

### Working Commands
Despite build limitations, these commands work correctly:

#### Static Analysis and Validation (All work perfectly)
```bash
# Check for unapproved characters - takes 2 seconds
src/build/ci/find-unapproved-chars.sh

# Check for unapproved JUnit usage - takes 1 second  
src/build/ci/find-unapproved-junit.sh

# Check package naming conventions - takes 1 second
src/build/ci/check-module-package-conventions.sh

# Check for startMini without stopMini - takes 1 second
src/build/ci/find-startMini-without-stopMini.sh

# Check for abstract IT classes - takes 1 second
src/build/ci/find-unapproved-abstract-ITs.sh
```

#### Maven Analysis Commands (Work for first 2 modules only)
```bash
# Show active profiles - works, takes 1 second
mvn help:active-profiles

# Validate first 2 modules (accumulo-project, accumulo-start) - takes 3 seconds, FAILS at accumulo-core
mvn -B validate -DverifyFormat

# Show effective POM - works, takes 1 second
mvn help:effective-pom -q
```

#### What Works in Validation
- **accumulo-project module**: Full validation including format checks (SUCCESS)
- **accumulo-start module**: Full validation including format checks (SUCCESS)
- **accumulo-core module and beyond**: FAIL due to dependency resolution (FAILS)

```

## Validation Workflows

### When Making Changes
1. **ALWAYS** run static analysis first (works in any environment):
   ```bash
   src/build/ci/find-unapproved-chars.sh
   src/build/ci/find-unapproved-junit.sh  
   src/build/ci/check-module-package-conventions.sh
   ```

2. **Test format validation on working modules** (takes 3 seconds, NEVER CANCEL):
   ```bash
   # This will validate accumulo-project and accumulo-start, then fail at accumulo-core
   mvn -B validate -DverifyFormat
   ```

3. **DO NOT attempt compilation** - it will fail due to missing accumulo-access dependency

### Module Analysis
- **start/**: Simple startup utilities, minimal dependencies, validates successfully
- **core/**: Contains core Accumulo APIs, depends on accumulo-access (fails)
- **shell/**: Interactive command-line interface for Accumulo
- **server/***: Various server components (manager, tablet server, etc.)

## Network Requirements
**CRITICAL**: This repository requires access to Apache snapshots repository which is not available in this environment.

Required but unavailable repositories:
- `https://repository.apache.org/snapshots` - **BLOCKED** (DNS resolution fails)

Available repositories:
- `https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2` - Maven Central (ACCESSIBLE)
- `https://repo1.maven.org` - Maven Central Mirror (ACCESSIBLE)

## Testing Capabilities

### What CAN Be Tested
- Code format validation (Java source formatting)
- Static code analysis (character validation, JUnit usage, package conventions)
- Maven project structure analysis
- Repository exploration and documentation

### What CANNOT Be Tested
- **Compilation**: Fails at accumulo-core due to missing dependencies
- **Unit Tests**: Cannot run due to compilation failure
- **Integration Tests**: Cannot run due to compilation failure
- **Application Startup**: Cannot test without successful build
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Not possible without working build

## CI/CD Context
Based on `.github/workflows/maven.yaml`:
- **Normal CI Build Time**: 60 minutes (with 60-minute timeout)  
- **Unit Tests**: Would normally take significant time with `-Xmx1G` heap
- **Integration Tests**: Require MiniCluster setup with substantial memory/disk
- **QA Checks**: Include SpotBugs, format verification, security scans

**In this environment**: Only static analysis and format validation work.

## Error Messages to Expect

### Build Failure
```
[ERROR] Could not transfer artifact org.apache.accumulo:accumulo-access:pom:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
from/to apache.snapshots (https://repository.apache.org/snapshots): repository.apache.org: 
No address associated with hostname
```

### DNS Resolution Failure  
```
** server can't find repository.apache.org: REFUSED
```

### Dependency Resolution
```
[ERROR] Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.apache.accumulo:accumulo-access:jar:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Build hangs or times out"
- **Expected**: Network timeouts when trying to reach Apache snapshots repository
- **Action**: Use static analysis tools instead of build commands

### "Cannot find accumulo-access dependency"
- **Expected**: This dependency is only in Apache snapshots repository  
- **Action**: Document the limitation; cannot be worked around

### "Single module builds fail"
- **Expected**: Maven enforcer rules require full reactor for module convergence
- **Action**: Use `mvn validate` for partial validation only

Remember: The goal is to document and understand this repository's structure and limitations, not to achieve a working build in this restricted environment.
